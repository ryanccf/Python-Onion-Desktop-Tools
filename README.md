# Python-Onion-Desktop-Tools
A Python port of Onion Desktop Tools written with Claude Code.

This is a version of [Onion Desktop Tools](https://github.com/schmurtzm/Onion-Desktop-Tools/tree/main) written in Python instead of Powershell.

Just run python3 main.py to use it.

I stopped working on this when I got it working, so it is probably really buggy, but I got it to the point I could install Onion on Debian, and I'm happy to give it to anyone who wants to work on it or use it.
