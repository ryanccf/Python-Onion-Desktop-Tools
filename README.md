# Linux-Onion-Desktop-Tools

This is a version of [Onion Desktop Tools](https://github.com/schmurtzm/Onion-Desktop-Tools/tree/main) written in Python (with Claude Code) instead of Powershell.

I also added a tool to download, verify, and install BIOS.

Just run LinuxDesktopTools-x86 to use it.

Shoutout @schmurtzm for developing the original!
