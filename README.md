# Linux Onion Desktop Tools

This is a version of [Onion Desktop Tools](https://github.com/schmurtzm/Onion-Desktop-Tools/tree/main) written in Python (with Claude Code) instead of Powershell.

I also added a tool to download, verify, and install BIOS.

[Download the binary from Itch](https://quintupleagames.itch.io/linux-onion-desktop-tools)

Just run "python3 main.py" or run the binary to to use it.

If you encounter bugs, please report them!

Shoutout @schmurtzm for developing the original!
